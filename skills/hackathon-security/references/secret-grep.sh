# secret-grep.sh — repo/working-tree + bundle secret scan for the hackathon build.
# Usage:
#   bash secret-grep.sh [path]        # default path: .
#   bash secret-grep.sh dist/         # bundle check after `npx expo export`
# Exit 0 = CLEAN (no pattern found). Exit 1 = HIT (a pattern matched — STOP).
# Smoke-tested 2026-11-13: matched 7/7 planted secrets (sk-proj- key,
# 39-char AIza Google key, sb_secret_, service_role,
# EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... in .env, RSA + OPENSSH private-key
# headers) and returned CLEAN on a clean tree (no false positive on
# EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL or plain strings). Never grep for a real key value.
#
# Two load-bearing details in the pattern:
# 1. The space inside (RSA |EC |OPENSSH )? — without it the pattern
#    requires the literal string "OPENSSHPRIVATE" and can never match a
#    real OpenSSH private-key header. The broken form
#    was run against a real header on 2026-11-13 and confirmed to miss it.
#    (The header is described, not quoted, here: quoting the literal
#    header text in this comment tripped gitleaks' own private-key rule
#    on this file — the kit repo was not gitleaks-clean under its own
#    config until this rewording, found 2026-11-14. The PATTERN line
#    below keeps the regex group form, which gitleaks does not flag.)
# 2. The AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{35} alternative — a Google API key is 39
#    chars total ("AIza" + 35). Without this alternative a Google key
#    in the bundle goes undetected (found in the same smoke test).
#
# 3. SELF-MATCH: this script and SKILL.md document the pattern, so they
#    match it themselves. When the repo grep (§6 item 1) runs on a tree
#    that contains this skill, exclude the skill directory (e.g. pass
#    the repo root but --exclude-dir=hackathon-security, or list the
#    skill's reference files as pre-approved known hits in CONTRACT.md).
#    Do NOT "fix" the self-match by weakening the pattern.
