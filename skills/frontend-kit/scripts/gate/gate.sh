# Deterministic gate for frontend-agent-kit (phase-1 research/SYNTHESIS.md §1 step 3 — workspace research note, not shipped in this repo),
# LEG 1 of 2 (reconciled 2026-11-10, probe 2): leg 1 is this file (taste
# lock + impeccable detect + static checks); leg 2 is gate.mjs (copy-lint
# + consistency browser leg). A "gate pass" means BOTH legs green on the
# same build. A PASS from this file on its own is only leg 1 — it never
# means the gate passed. When the legs disagree, the build is not green.
#
# Runs BEFORE any vision grade: a gate cannot lie to itself, and no vision
# round is ever spent on a build the gate already fails. FAIL blocks the round.
#
# What it checks, in order:
#   1. Taste lock (F6/H8): design/tokens.css MUST exist in the project dir —
#      the tokens are committed BEFORE any HTML (§1 step 1). A project with
#      no taste lock gets no pass, even if every other check is green.
#      Existence is not enough: the file must be NON-EMPTY and define at
#      least one custom property (--*) that the page's CSS/HTML actually
#      references (var(--*) or a literal use). An empty tokens file, or a
#      file whose tokens the page never uses, FAILS. The file's own
#      definitions do not count as use.
#      design/screenshots/ and design/variants/ are NOT required here: the
#      build loop creates them, so their absence is not a gate failure
#      (see scripts/gate/README.md, "Gate scope" — a template matter, not
#      a gate matter).
#   1b. Demo pass criterion, scripted (H15(1)): when the target IS
#      design/demo.html, the prose criterion "renders every listed token
#      visibly" becomes a check — every token in the demo header's
#      EXPECTED TOKENS block must be defined in design/tokens.css AND
#      referenced in the demo body (after the header comment, which names
#      the tokens and so cannot count as use). A demo exercising only
#      some of its listed tokens proves nothing about the rest.
#   2. impeccable detect (62 deterministic rules) — run per BUILT .html file
#      (F15), never on a directory: directory mode is regex-only and
#      approximate (see N7), and a whole-directory scan also sweeps in
#      design/variants/ — unpicked alternatives the human never chose. A
#      broken variant must never fail the build gate. Per-variant gating
#      stays explicit: gate the variants dir itself to scan the variants.
#      If no engine is reachable via --launcher (or the installed
#      ~/.agents/skills copy), the detect leg is SKIPPED — and a skipped
#      detect is "gate not run", never a pass (F6): the gate FAILS.
#   3. Static checks (no browser needed): every .html under the target has a
#      viewport meta; no file:// links; every local <img src>/stylesheet
#      reference resolves to a file. Non-file schemes are exempt (F-1,
#      probe 3): mailto:, tel:, javascript:, data:, #anchors, http(s): —
#      they are not file references, so a legitimate mailto: CTA must not
#      fail as "referenced file missing". Exactly those schemes are
#      exempt, no others (a protocol-relative // URL or an unknown scheme
#      still has to resolve — see the F-1 note in gate.mjs's header).
#      References are extracted in all three
#      quoting forms — double-quoted, single-quoted, and unquoted
#      (src='x.png', src=x.png) — not double-quoted only (H8). A missing
#      reference fails with its exact line (`<file>:<line>: referenced
#      file missing: <ref>`, M3) — the line is the line of the src/href
#      attribute in the page. design/variants/
#      is excluded from the build-output scan (same reason as step 2) — unless
#      the target IS a variants dir (an explicit per-variant gate).
#      design/demo.html is likewise excluded from project-dir scans (it is
#      the taste-lock proof artifact, gated explicitly on its own file) —
#      unless the target IS the demo file itself.
#      .taste-skill/ is excluded from every scan (probe G-7): gate.mjs's
#      consistency run used to write rendered.html + crops there, inside
#      the project, and this file then failed on the checker's own
#      artifact. gate.mjs now defaults its output to the OS temp dir; the
#      exclusion here is defence in depth.
#   3b. Visual-marker check (tightened 2026-11-10, probe 2): a built page
#      that contains <section> elements must contain at least one real
#      visual marker — <img>, <picture>, <video>, <canvas>, or a [data-ui]
#      UI mock. Small inline SVG icons do NOT count (the browser leg
#      measures them at 32px and they cover ~0% of a section). This is a
#      STATIC PROXY for gate.mjs's no-visual check (which measures >=25%
#      coverage per section in the browser); coverage itself is leg 2's
#      job, not this file's. It fires only on project-dir scans of pages
#      with sections — never on the single-file demo target (a token
#      proof, not a page) and never on a page with no sections (e.g. the
#      verify.sh fixture).
#   3c. Anti-cliché seed checks (P1, 2026-11-10): scripts/gate/
#      anti-cliche.mjs on the built pages — AC-1 (purple-pink-blue
#      gradient) and AC-2 (emoji as icon). SEEDED from garden-skills,
#      not grown from an observed failure (see anti-cliche.md); a
#      finding still fails the gate. Waived only by an explicit
#      "Anti-cliche allow: AC-<n>" hard rule in design/TASTE.md. Runs
#      when node is available; skipped with a warning otherwise (same
#      pattern as the optional validators below). Never on the demo or
#      v0 single-file targets (a token proof / a skeleton, not a page).
#   3d. Token-naming lint (P17, 2026-11-10): scripts/gate/
#      lint-tokens.mjs on the built pages + design/tokens.css — T1
#      kebab-case token names, T2 no primitive references in component
#      CSS, T3 on-* text role for every --color-* used as a background,
#      T4 colour roles alias primitives, never literals. A finding
#      fails the gate. Runs when node is available and design/tokens.css
#      exists; skipped with a note otherwise (the verify.sh fixture's
#      tokens are not --color-* roles, so it stays green). Runs on the
#      demo target too — the template must pass its own lint.
#   4. Optional validators when installed: html-validate, pa11y
#      (--standard WCAG2AA). Absent = skipped with a warning, never fatal.
#      D47: pa11y is WEB-ONLY. On a native-app target (--native) pa11y
#      never runs and is recorded "N/A — native app"; the native-app a11y
#      gate is the manual checklist (VoiceOver/TalkBack + 200% text on the
#      real phone — swarm/app-quality-brief.md §1.6), printed PENDING by
#      this step, never a fake pass. A web run with zero .html files prints
#      an explicit nothing-scanned note instead of passing pa11y vacuously.
#   5. Converge check (P2, 2026-11-10): scripts/gate/converge-check.mjs
#      against every built page — but ONLY when design/PLAN.md exists
#      under the project dir (step 1 writes the plan; a build without a
#      plan cannot be converge-checked, and the verify.sh fixture has
#      none — so absence skips with a note, never a failure). A missing
#      planned section/state FAILS the gate and blocks the human gate.
#      Runs when node is available; skipped with a warning otherwise —
#      in that case the orchestrator runs the converge checklist by hand
#      before the human gate (see skills/frontend-kit/references/
#      converge-checklist.md). Never on a variants-dir target (the
#      unpicked alternatives are not the deliverable) and never on the
#      demo single-file target.
#   6. Security stage (2026-11-11, cross-check §14): the deterministic
#      Stage 1 checks 1.1–1.12 from research/security-ai/SYNTHESIS.md §3
#      (workspace research note, not shipped in this repo)
#      — 1.1 secret scan (gitleaks/trufflehog), 1.2–1.5 sink greps
#      (innerHTML/eval/template-injection/unvalidated URLs), 1.6
#      dependency existence + pinning + lockfile + integrity (npm view),
#      1.7 CVE (osv-scanner, else npm audit), 1.8 headers (CSP/HSTS,
#      no ACAO:*), 1.9 weak crypto, 1.10 licence scan
#      (license-checker, deny GPL/AGPL/SSPL/BUSL/Elastic/unknown),
#      1.11 rate limits / token budgets on LLM/API features, 1.12
#      lifecycle scripts disabled in CI + allowlist. Per-check output
#      `SECURITY 1.<n>: PASS | FAIL | N/A — <reason>`. FAIL-CLOSED: a
#      check whose subject is present but whose tool is missing FAILS,
#      naming the missing tool — never a silent pass. A check whose
#      SUBJECT is absent (no dependencies, no server, no LLM/API call,
#      no CI) is N/A with its reason printed. Runs after §5 in every
#      gate run, and standalone via --security-only. This is the
#      deterministic [GATE] half of the step-3a cross-check; the LLM/human
#      half (Stages 0, 2–6) runs as an independent agent
#      (experts/security.md, references/security-checklist.md) and is
#      recorded with run-log.mjs crosscheck — it is NOT this section.
#      RESOLVED 2026-11-11 (verification §1): OWASP LLM edition PINNED
#      to 2026 (released 3–4 Aug 2026, announced 1–2 Sep 2026); checks
#      cite LLM IDs with the :2026 suffix. Honest boundary: the full
#      122-page PDF could not be text-extracted (download 403); the
#      order rests on repo structure + Preface + LLM08 + unanimous
#      secondaries. ASVS 5.0.0 L1/L2 ADOPTED as the checklist layer
#      (verification §2); ASI IDs were NOT re-verified. 1.8's CSP
#      directives rest on the CSP Cheat Sheet via a DeepWiki summary
#      only (§8.6); 1.6's slopsquatting rationale rests on the USENIX
#      2025 abstract + introduction only (full paper CHƯA ĐỌC, §8.6).
#
# Usage: gate.sh --target <dir-or-file> [--launcher <path-to-impeccable>] [--security-only] [--native]
#        gate.sh --self-test   (runs against its own bundled fixture logic)
#        --native: the target is a native app (Expo/React Native) — pa11y is
#        web-only, so it is recorded "N/A — native app" and the manual a11y
#        checklist (VoiceOver/TalkBack + 200% text on the real phone) is
#        printed PENDING, never passed (D47).
# Exit: 0 pass, 2 findings/fail, 1 usage error.

# --- nested kit-clone exclusion (D14, GAP-12) -------------------------------
# A directory nested inside the project that IS the kit's own repo clone
# (it carries BOTH install.sh AND skills/frontend-kit/SKILL.md at its
# root) is install source, not project content: the probe-3 trap was a
# gate that scanned the clone sitting inside the project dir (leg 1
# failed on 333 clone/vendor issues, none about the built page). The
# exclusion is LOCATION + IDENTITY, never content or filename, so D9
# holds: a lab/demo/catalog file genuinely copied into the project
# (outside the nested clone) is still scanned and still fails.
# The exclusion NEVER fires on $project_dir itself (the detection walk
# uses -mindepth 1): when the target IS the kit repo (kit development,
# CI), the gate scans it whole. A SYMLINKED clone is not excluded: it
# fails the §6 symlink check by design (copy the real dir in).
# Each excluded clone is announced with note(), so the leg-1 log shows
# what was skipped — a silent exclusion would be unauditable.
# Exception (D34): the §6 1.1 secret text pass DOES scan a nested clone
# (its find drops the clone exclusion — the sec_11 find only). A secret
# in grep-only shape inside a clone must still fail 1.1; the other four
# find sites (html, css, symlink, sec_grep) keep the exclusion.
# Gitleaks is deliberately NOT excluded (it scans $project_dir whole):
# it PASSED over the clone in probe 3, and a secret inside the clone
# is a true positive about the kit tree.
# Depth: any depth under $project_dir (one find walk; the gate already
# runs several full-tree finds). A found clone's subdirs are skipped in
# the loop — they can never be a second clone worth a second note.
# Bash 3.2 (macOS phase, D12): expanding an empty array under `set -u`

# defect 2): fail closed on ANY symlink in the scanned scope. The §6 greps
# build their file list with `find -type f`, which never yields a symlinked
# file or anything under a symlinked directory, and gitleaks 8.30.1 likewise
# does not follow symlinks (verified: a symlinked secret file scans as "no
# leaks found", and a symlinked assets/ dir with a tampered sink passes 1.2
# with SECURITY RESULT: PASS). A shipped static site has no legitimate need
# for symlinks in its deliverable tree, so the gate fails loudly and names
# every link instead of resolving them: `find -L` alone would fix the grep
# layer but NOT the gitleaks 1.1 layer, so fail-on-symlink is the control
# that closes both.
# Scope, named explicitly (the FAIL message below says the same — the old
# message claimed "symlink(s) under %s" with no qualification while dirs
# were excluded): the project tree MINUS node_modules, .git,
# .taste-skill, and any excluded nested kit clone (D14, GAP-12 — a clone
# dir's own symlinks, e.g. its .hermes link, are not reported either). design/variants is NOT excluded here (re-QC defect 2):
# variants are kit-owned, never legitimately symlinked, and the gate can be
# run explicitly against a variants dir — so a symlink in design/variants
# fails, even though a REGULAR sink file there still passes 1.2 by the
# scans' design (unpicked alternatives, excluded from the scans; the
# deliverable gate re-scans on copy). The symlink check is deliberately
# stricter than the scans in variants.
# Asymmetries, stated, not hidden: (a) a TOP-LEVEL node_modules symlink IS
# caught (its path is ".../node_modules" with no trailing "/node_modules/"
# segment, so the exclusion does not match it), while symlinks NESTED
# inside node_modules are not — pnpm legitimately symlinks there, so
# failing there would false-positive on real projects; a monorepo layout
# that symlinks the node_modules directory itself therefore fails the gate
# (copy the real directory in instead). (b) Symlinks inside .git/ and
# .taste-skill/ are not caught — out of scan scope by design, and a symlink
# there is no worse than a regular file there (neither is scanned, neither
# is served). (c) TOCTOU is a labelled hypothesis, accepted, no fix: the
# window between this find and the later scans is milliseconds and needs a
# concurrent writer during the gate run; a writer active during the gate
# could also modify files after the gate. The project dir itself being a
# symlink fails too: GNU find with default -P does not descend into a
# symlinked operand at all, so without the -L check below the scans would
# go vacuous — that check is load-bearing, do not remove it.

# --- 1.1 secret scan ---------------------------------------------------------
# Tool: gitleaks (preferred) or trufflehog, per synthesis §7 (three-layer
# defence: pre-commit → push protection → CI). The built-in high-confidence
# pattern grep ALWAYS runs first and its matches are printed — but a clean
# grep is NOT a scanner verdict: with no scanner installed the check
# FAILS, naming the missing tool (fail closed; a pattern scan is not a
# secret scanner). A grep hit FAILS outright, scanner or not.
# Gitleaks runs with the kit config scripts/gate/.gitleaks.toml (extends
# gitleaks' defaults; allowlists ONLY design/run-log.jsonl, the
# Impeccable seed files (.impeccable/questions/seeds/*.json +
# questions/seed-salt) and the D15 judge reports
# (design/judge/round-*.md — their stamped sha256 headers trip
# generic-api-key exactly as tokensHash does; added 2026-11-12 after
# the M1 live proof) — see the config's own comment for the verified OR
# semantics and the residual holes). The built-in grep below ALSO scans
# design/run-log.jsonl AND the seed files, so a real secret in either
# still FAILS even though gitleaks skips the file; tokensHash itself
# matches neither grep pattern. The judge reports need no dedicated
# grep block: the RR2-07 text pass further down already runs the same
# three patterns over every project text file, design/judge/*.md
# included, and the stamped header lines match none of them (verified
# against the real Brief 1 artifact) — a known-shaped secret in judge
# prose still FAILS 1.1 there. GAP-10 correction (D10, council-2): for a
# ghp_ + 20-char token the backstop grep is the ONLY layer — gitleaks'
# github-pat rule needs 36 chars, so gitleaks would not have caught it
# even without the allowlist; the backstop must never be dropped as
# "defence in depth we can skip". The assign pattern accepts an optional
# closing quote between keyword and colon (D10 widening) AND whitespace
# after that quote (RT-04 fix), so a JSON-quoted "api_key": "..." and a
# spaced "api_key" : "..." assignment both match — verified a strict
# superset with no new false positive on the seed shape {"key": "<32-hex>"}
# or on tokensHash lines. The unquoted pattern below (RT-09 G6) catches
# a bare hex value ("api_key": <20-hex>, no quotes — not valid JSON, so
# no JSON normalisation can save it). Hex-only, not general alnum: a
# value such as process.env.DB_PASSWORD must NOT match (its first hex
# run is short, then a dot breaks it). The hex run also requires a
# TERMINATOR (RR-08, fix round 2): the character after the run must be a
# non-hex, non-alphanumeric, non-dot character or end-of-line, so a
# dotted identifier whose first run is 16+ hex chars
# (api_key: <16-hex>.process) does NOT match — it is an identifier, not a
# bare hex value. Both assign patterns are
# case-insensitive (-i) at every use site.
# KEYWORD WIDENING (RR2-04, fix round 3; RR3-02, fix round 4B): the
# keyword fragment accepts an optional continuation that must start
# with '_', a digit, '-', or '.' — or a space/tab starting a spaced
# continuation — so api_key2, secret_key, secret-key, secret.key,
# password-hash, api-key-2 and "api key" all match, while secretary (a
# bare letter continuing the word) does NOT. A trailing space/tab also

# HIGH-CONFIDENCE WIDENING (RR2-05, fix round 3): the sk- family covers

# account keys sk-svcacct- and admin keys sk-admin-, and Anthropic keys
# sk-ant- (api03/admin01/oat01 and later, via the open sk-ant- arm).
# CASE (RR3-06, fix round 4B): sec_11_pat is grepped with -i at EVERY
# use site (sec_grep, run-log, seeds, text pass, and the example-strip
# re-test below runs with nocasematch) — so SK-PROJ- / SK-ANT- match
# too, agreeing with HIGH_CONF_RE's `i` flag and with the already
# case-insensitive assign patterns. Issued keys are lowercase, so an
# uppercased prefix is not a usable credential; the -i is for
# layer agreement, not for a live credential shape.
# MAINTENANCE HAZARD: this pattern is DUPLICATED in runlog-check.mjs's
# HIGH_CONF_RE (same alternation, JS syntax vs bash ERE) — change both
# together; they are kept as two copies because one lives in bash and

# RT-09 structural check (2026-11-11), rewritten as a node helper in fix
# round 2 (RR-05 + RR-07): the engine writes exactly one shape per file —
# a seeds file is {"key": "<32-lower-hex>"} and nothing else, the salt file
# is one 32-lower-hex line — so any deviation fails 1.1 here, which closes
# the pattern-evasion shapes at once: an extra field holding a bare 64-hex
# string (G1), a secret split across two fields (G2), a unicode-escaped
# keyword (G3 — JSON.parse decodes \u005f to _), a multi-line key/value
# split (G4 — JSON is whitespace-insensitive), an array of bare strings
# (G9 — not an object), an escaped-quote value (G10 — the decoded value is
# not 32 lower-hex), an apostrophe-split value (G17 — same). The
# unquoted-value pattern above closes G6, which is not valid JSON and so
# cannot reach the structural check. FAIL-CLOSED on unparseable input
# (RR-05): a file that does not parse as JSON FAILS 1.1 loudly — a UTF-8
# BOM prefix (read with BOM stripping, the utf-8-sig equivalent, so a BOM
# no longer switches the check off), trailing garbage after the JSON value
# (JSON.parse requires exactly one value), a bare string instead of an
# object, an empty file. A legitimate seeds file always parses, so "does
# not parse" is a structural hit, never a silent no-verdict. The helper is
# scripts/gate/seed-structural.mjs (node — the gate's existing scripting
# runtime, same pattern as dompurify-call.mjs); the python3 dependency is
# GONE, so there is no fallback to be inequivalent (RR-07). If node or the
# helper is unavailable while seed files exist, 1.1 FAILS CLOSED naming
# node — a security check that cannot run is a BLOCK, never a silent pass.
# Format-pinning risk, stated: if upstream ever changes the seed format,
# this check fails loudly and the kit must update the pinned shape — the

# sec_scan_files (above) covers only *.js/*.mjs/*.css + html +

# gitleaks-only — and gitleaks misses low-entropy secrets there (a
# word-phrase password in notes.txt passed 1.1 entirely; 1 of 7 random
# AKIA keys in .txt files was missed by gitleaks 8.30.1 — reproduced
# 2026-11-11, the missed key caught by this grep pass). This pass runs
# the same three 1.1 patterns over every regular file under the project
# and ONLY feeds 1.1 — it is separate from sec_scan_files, so
# 1.2/1.3/etc. never start failing on prose mentions. FP-checked
# against the whole repo tree before shipping: the only hit is the AWS
# documentation example key in skills/frontend-kit/experts/security.md
# (an illustrative example, not a credential — gitleaks itself passes
# it, verified 2026-11-11), so that exact literal is exempted below: a
# hit line is kept only if a secret shape remains after stripping the
# literal from it (a line holding ONLY the example key is dropped; a
# line holding the example key PLUS a real secret is still kept). What
# this pass does NOT catch, by name: a bare word-phrase password with
# NO keyword label — no pattern recognises it; that remainder stays
# documented.
# EXCLUSIONS (RR3-04, fix round 4B; justification corrected fix round 5
# per re-QC #4 OBS-1): this is a SECRET scan, not a build scan, so it does
# NOT inherit sec_scan_files' design/variants/ exclusion — a secret in an
# unpicked variant still ships in version control, and gitleaks' generic
# rule there only fires next to a keyword label. design/variants/ IS
# scanned here. node_modules/ and .taste-skill/ stay excluded (third-party
# / vendored-upstream trees, normally gitignored, not user-written project
# files — a secret there does not ship in version control). The residual
# differs by subtree: gitleaks 8.30.1 scans ~0 bytes under node_modules/,
# so a secret of ANY shape there passes all 1.1 layers; .taste-skill/ IS
# scanned by gitleaks, so only a label-dependent gitleaks miss there is
# unclosed by the grep pass. .git/ stays excluded (not project content).
# D13 (GAP-11): design/gate-leg1.log + design/gate-leg2.log are excluded
# from THIS grep pass too, mirroring the .taste-skill/ exclusion — the
# gate's own prior output must never fail the next gate run (a secret
# echoed into a gate log would fail 1.1 on the gate's own artifact).
# The exclusion is grep-pass-only: gitleaks still scans the logs, so a
# real secret in a log is still caught by the scanner layer — the
# failure mode stays fail-closed (a noisy 1.1 FAIL naming the log),
# never a silent pass.
# ENCODING (RR3-03, fix round 4B): the pass is UTF-16-aware — see
# sec_11_utf16_enc / sec_11_text_grep below. A UTF-16 file is binary
# to grep -I (skipped) and NUL-interleaved to grep -a (patterns never
# match), and gitleaks 8.30.1 misses UTF-16 too, so UTF-16 files are
# transcoded to UTF-8 (iconv, NUL-strip fallback) before grepping.
# Removing -I alone is NOT a fix and was not done.

# BOM, the first 1 MiB is scanned for NUL-interleaved ASCII (fix round 5,
# RR4-03: the old 512-byte window missed a file whose first 512 bytes were
# NUL-free CJK text). NULs at odd byte offsets => LE, at even offsets => BE.
# The vote is decode-first, NOT parity-majority (fix round 5, RR4-02): a
# UTF-16LE character whose low byte is 00 (U+0100-U+FF00 range, incl. common
# CJK like U+4E00) contributes an EVEN-offset NUL, so a LE file whose
# non-ASCII content outweighs its ASCII is voted BE by parity alone — and
# the wrong decode of U+xx00 text is ASCII soup (each U+xx00 char becomes
# one ASCII byte), so a raw ASCII-byte count can vote wrong too (a 70-char
# U+4E00 prefix out-counts a 62-char secret line). The decision rule is
# therefore: the winning decode is trusted only when the LOSER shows at
# most 2 ASCII bytes — a wrong decode yields ASCII only from U+xx00
# characters, so a near-zero loser means the winner's ASCII is real; any
# other split is AMBIGUOUS and prints the bare sentinel `UTF-16`, which
# tells sec_11_text_grep to transcode the file BOTH ways and grep each
# (a hit in either decoding fails the gate — the vote can no longer bury
# a secret). When NEITHER decode shows ASCII in the window, parity is
# the fallback (it can only misjudge a file with no ASCII secret in the
# window), and parity ties go to LE, the common Windows case (the old code
# sent ties to BE, contradicting this comment). The NUL count is done by
# od -v piped to awk (fix round 5, RR4-01): od without -v collapses
# repeated 16-byte lines into `*`, corrupting the count, and the bash
# char-by-char loop over a hex string is replaced outright, which removes
# the whole class. Remainder: the window is the first 1 MiB — a file whose
# first 1 MiB carries no ASCII evidence for its true encoding (e.g. over
# 1 MiB of U+xx00 CJK before the secret) can still be misdetected.
# UTF-32 (FF FE 00 00) is NOT handled: it matches the LE BOM branch
# and transcodes to NUL-separated ASCII the patterns still miss — a
# documented remainder, not a tested shape.
# Fix round 6 (RR5-01, RR5-02): the decode counts are only trusted when
# iconv succeeds — GNU iconv stops at the first illegal sequence (a lone
# surrogate is illegal) and outputs only the prefix, so a count from a
# failed decode measures the prefix, not the file, and a failed decode
# casts no decisive vote (ambiguous → both-ways). And a BOM is
# corroborated, not trusted blindly: the decode vote runs even on BOM'd
# files, and when it contradicts the BOM the vote wins (or the file goes
# ambiguous); the BOM is trusted only when the window carries no ASCII

# --- 1.2 HTML sinks (innerHTML / document.write) ---------------------------
# Flag any dangerouslySetInnerHTML / innerHTML= / outerHTML= /
# document.write( in a file that does not also CALL DOMPurify.sanitize
# (the sanctioned sanitizer per OWASP LLM10:2026). A file that calls it
# is passed with a note — the per-occurrence taint check (is THIS sink fed
# by untrusted data?) is checklist territory (Stage 1.2 human/LLM half);
# the gate enforces the mechanical half: no unsanitized sink at all.
# RT-02 fix (2026-11-11), hardened in fix round 2 (RR-01, RR-02, RR-10,
# RR-13): the exception requires a genuine CALL, not the bare string —
# scripts/gate/dompurify-call.mjs strips comments, string/template
# literals and regex literals (regex-vs-division heuristic) before testing
# for an ANCHORED call site (the DOMPurify identifier itself, optionally
# behind window./globalThis./self.; x.DOMPurify, notDOMPurify and
# $DOMPurify do NOT count; bracket notation DOMPurify['sanitize']() DOES
# count), so a comment mentioning DOMPurify.sanitize no longer passes a
# sink. See that file for the stated limits (template ${...} calls,
# aliasing, the regex/division heuristic's ambiguous cases).
# Fix round 3 (RR2-01/02/08/10): the stripped text is normalised
# (\s*\.\s* -> '.') before the anchor runs, so whitespace around a dot
# can no longer smuggle a foreign-object call past it; the tokenizer
# tracks statement position after if/while/for/with and treats
# whitespace as neutral; bracket access on the global alias
# (window['DOMPurify']) counts, and regex flags are [dgimsuvy] only.
# NO grep fallback (RR-13, fix round 2): the old fallback (a call-shaped
# grep excluding full-line comment lines) passed a trailing-comment call
# shape — `el.innerHTML=q; // DOMPurify.sanitize(q)` — exactly the shape
# RT-02 was about, so the fallback was strictly weaker than the helper in
# the one shape that matters. The fallback is DELETED: when node or the
# helper is unavailable, a sink file that is not hash-exempt FAILS 1.2
# loudly naming node/the helper (fail closed; a security check that
# cannot run is a BLOCK, never a silent pass — same rule as 1.1's
# structural checks, RR-07/RR-12). A byte-identical vendored file still
# passes by exemption without the helper, since the exemption needs no
# call-site verification. A project with no sink files passes 1.2
# vacuously with or without the helper.
#
# GAP-9 (D9) hash exemption: a file is ALSO passed with a note if its
# path relative to the project dir AND its sha256 both match
# scripts/gate/vendored-allowlist.txt (committed manifest, taste pin
# v2.5.1, 27 runtime files). Lab/demo/catalog files are NEVER listed —
# if one is copied into a project, 1.2 fails on it. A vendored file
# copied to any other project path does not match (fail closed on
# relocation). A missing manifest means no exemption, with a printed
# note; a stale manifest (hash mismatch) likewise exempts nothing —
# that loud failure is the correct behaviour, not a bug. Do NOT inline
# vendored JS into the page: leg-2 1.2 (gate.mjs) scans only the page
# file, so inlined vendored JS still fails there — keep vendored JS as
# separate files under assets/.
# Residual risk, printed on EVERY exemption (the security expert's
# per-occurrence taint check owns it, checklist 1.2, pre-land and
# pre-ship): the runtime class-E sites ui/notify/fragment.js:16,
# ui/search/fragment.js:20,
# scenes/letter-bar-floods-the-ground/scene.js:41 (caller-/page-fed,
# unescaped), ui/ui.js:106 (fetched local fragment.html carrying client
# copy), diagrams/diagram.js:229 (fetched local icon SVG through
# hand-rolled regex cleaning), plus the class-C feeds generally.
# diagrams/lab.html:126 is NOT exempt and NOT on this list.
# RR5-03 (fix round 6): NUL-delimited — the old `sec_grep | cut -d: -f1`
# list split a newline-named sink file into bogus paths (and a colon-named
# file at the colon), and the loop then failed each bogus path because the
# DOMPurify helper cannot verify a nonexistent file, so a sanitized sink
# FAILed 1.2. The file list is now built with grep -lZ over the same
# scanned set sec_grep uses (sec_scan_files minus .css), sorted -z and
# read with read -d '', so newlines and colons in filenames survive.
# (The RR5 HYPOTHESIS — a list fragment coinciding with a real exempt
# path — is mooted by removing the newline-joined construction entirely.)
